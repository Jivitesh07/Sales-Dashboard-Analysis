# Sales-Dashboard-Analysis

Data analysis and visualization project demonstrating skills in data cleaning with Python/Pandas and interactive dashboard creation using Power BI or Tableau. Focuses on transforming raw sales data into actionable business intelligence.

Key Features of the Sales Dashboard Project - 

Python/Pandas ETL: Uses Python (specifically the Pandas library) to perform the initial Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process. This includes handling data loading from the CSV.
Date Transformation: Transforms the raw Order Date column into a sortable and usable Month-Year format (YYYY-MM), which is critical for time-series analysis.
Data Aggregation: Calculates aggregated metrics (total sales, profit by region, etc.) that feed directly into the dashboard visuals, ensuring data accuracy and efficiency.
KPI Tracking: Features clear Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards for quick monitoring of metrics like Total Sales and Total Profit.
Visual Highlighting: Uses color coding to emphasize top-performing areas (e.g., highlighting the highest-selling region or category), making key insights immediately obvious to the user.
